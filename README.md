🚀 Project Name
(e.g. custom-devops-pipeline)

A concise description: what the pipeline automates, its main purpose, and who benefits from it.

🧠 Overview
Purpose: Explain why this pipeline exists—CI/CD workflow, deployment orchestration, infrastructure provisioning, etc.

Audience: Developers, DevOps engineers, administrators

Scope: Technologies used (e.g. GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Terraform), supported environments (dev/staging/production)

📦 Quick Start
bash
Copy code
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/custom-devops-pipeline.git
cd custom-devops-pipeline

# Setup prerequisites
make setup

# Run tests
make test

# Trigger pipeline locally or via CLI
./run-pipeline.sh
Include any one-command setup or execution method—even better with scripts to automate this.

🏗 Architecture & Flow
Embed a Mermaid or Draw.io flowchart illustrating pipeline stages and decision paths.

“The readme file should have a diagram and few bullet points as to what each steps does”

Provide a bullet-list plain-text overview of stages: build, test, deploy, validate, etc.

“For complex pipelines, I keep a README.md in the repo with: Pipeline stages overview; Required env vars; Common failure points; Deployment validation steps”
